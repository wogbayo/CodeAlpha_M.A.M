To anyone you choses the "SELFT-TAUGHT" approach to web developing, hear this, you are not alone.
The resources here may not be enough but these were the first projects I did and I will remain proud of them.
This is my second attempt at thios internship...and if you are finally reading this, just know i completed it and i am proud i did.
I bare had up to two week of Jvascript and most lines of code may not be the conventional approach and my system of name my sound alien...lol
but i believe that the code would be funtional and serve the very core purpose why it was written.
