To anyone you choses the "SELFT-TAUGHT" approach to web developing, hear this, you are not alone.
The resources here may not be enough but these were the first projects I did and I will remain proud of them.
This is my second attempt at a CodeAlpha internship...and if you are finally reading this, just know i completed it and i am proud i did.
As at the time of starting this, I barely had twoweek of Jvascript under my sleeves, so, most lines of code may not be the conventional approach and my system of naming may sound alien...lol. I believe that the code would be funtional and serve the very core purpose why it was written.
